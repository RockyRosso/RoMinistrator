# About RoMinistrator

RoMinistrator is a Roblox game management service which allows admins to connect their Roblox game to a self-hosted Discord bot. Through this Discord bot, admins will be allowed to:

-   Ban
-   Kick
-   Warn (Coming Soon!)
-   Lock Their Games
-   ...and more!

RoMinistrator does allow you to create custom commands, but this does require some experience with Javascript, and using the [Eris Discord library](https://abal.moe/Eris/).
